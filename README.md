# xox_player

Eventually this will be a cross platform app to simply play the WXOX radio stream.
Ideally this will be easily customized/repurposed by other stations, and maintained by the 
community so that nobody has to build one of these again.

## TODO

- Fix the "playing time" clock thing (progress bar has been removed).
- Probably need this background audio thingy: https://pub.dev/packages/audio_service
- Look into how to replace the flutter spash screen with a WXOX logo.
- Icons
- Package names etc need to be sorted out so that we can publish this to app store 
  properly - eg, we want this to appear as an update for existing users.
