# xox_player


Big thanks to

## TODO

- Probably need this background audio thingy: https://pub.dev/packages/audio_service
- WXOX logo
- Get rid of the progress bar and just show the playing time and maybe
  a simple animation?
- Look into how to replace the flutter spash screen with a WXOX logo.
- Package names etc need to be sorted out so that we can publish this to app store 
  properly - eg, we want this to appear as an update for existing users.
